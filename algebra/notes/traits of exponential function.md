# Traits of Exponential Function

## 1. **Exponential Function: \(y = ab^x\)**

- **Horizontal Asymptote**: The graph has a horizontal asymptote at \(y = 0\), which represents the value the function approaches as \(x\) becomes very large or very small, but never quite reaches.

- **Growth/Decay**:

  - **If \(b > 1\)**: The function exhibits **exponential growth** as \(x\) increases. The graph rises rapidly as \(x\) moves to the right.
  - **If \(0 < b < 1\)**: The function exhibits **exponential decay** as \(x\) increases. The graph falls as \(x\) moves to the right.

- **Intercept**: The function will always pass through the point \((0, a)\), since \(y = ab^0 = a\).

- **End Behavior**:
  - **As \(x \to \infty\)** (positive infinity):
    - For growth (\(b > 1\)), \(y \to \infty\).
    - For decay (\(0 < b < 1\)), \(y \to 0^+\) (approaches 0 from above).
  - **As \(x \to -\infty\)** (negative infinity):
    - For growth (\(b > 1\)), \(y \to 0^+\).
    - For decay (\(0 < b < 1\)), \(y \to \infty\).

## 2. **Exponential Function: \(x = ab^y\)**

- **Vertical Asymptote**: The graph has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 0\), representing the value the function approaches as \(y\) becomes very large or very small, but never reaches.

- **Growth/Decay**:

  - **If \(b > 1\)**: The function exhibits **exponential growth** as \(y\) increases. The graph moves further to the right as \(y\) increases.
  - **If \(0 < b < 1\)**: The function exhibits **exponential decay** as \(y\) increases. The graph moves closer to the vertical asymptote as \(y\) increases.

- **Intercept**: The function will always pass through the point \((a, 0)\), since \(x = ab^0 = a\).

- **End Behavior**:
  - **As \(y \to \infty\)** (positive infinity):
    - For growth (\(b > 1\)), \(x \to \infty\).
    - For decay (\(0 < b < 1\)), \(x \to 0^+\).
  - **As \(y \to -\infty\)** (negative infinity):
    - For growth (\(b > 1\)), \(x \to 0^+\).
    - For decay (\(0 < b < 1\)), \(x \to \infty\).

## Additional Traits:

1. **Domain and Range**:

   - For \(y = ab^x\), the **domain** is all real numbers (\(-\infty, \infty\)). The **range** depends on the sign of \(a\):
     - If \(a > 0\): \(y > 0\).
     - If \(a < 0\): \(y < 0\).
   - For \(x = ab^y\), the **range** is all real numbers (\(-\infty, \infty\)). The **domain** depends on the sign of \(a\):
     - If \(a > 0\): \(x > 0\).
     - If \(a < 0\): \(x < 0\).

2. **Transformations**:
   - **Vertical Shift**: Adding/subtracting a constant \(k\) to \(y = ab^x\) shifts the graph up/down.
   - **Horizontal Shift**: Adding/subtracting a constant \(h\) inside the exponent, i.e., \(y = ab^{x-h}\), shifts the graph left/right.
   - **Reflection**: If \(a\) is negative, the graph is reflected over the x-axis.

These concepts apply to many real-world situations, such as population growth, radioactive decay, and financial modeling.
