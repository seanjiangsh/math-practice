If you do not know the simplified form \(-\frac{3}{x + 4} + 2\) in advance, you can still simplify the expression \(\frac{2x + 5}{x + 4}\) using a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step method to derive that form without prior knowledge:

### Step 1: Perform Long Division

You can simplify the expression by performing polynomial long division, dividing the numerator \(2x + 5\) by the denominator \(x + 4\).

1. **Set up the division:**

   - Divide the first term of the numerator \(2x\) by the first term of the denominator \(x\):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{x} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first part of the quotient is \(2\).

2. **Multiply the quotient by the divisor:**

   - Multiply \(2\) by the entire denominator \(x + 4\):
     \[
     2 \cdot (x + 4) = 2x + 8
     \]

3. **Subtract from the original numerator:**
   - Subtract \(2x + 8\) from \(2x + 5\):
     \[
     (2x + 5) - (2x + 8) = -3
     \]

### Step 2: Write the Result as a Mixed Expression

Now, express the result of the division:
\[
\frac{2x + 5}{x + 4} = 2 + \frac{-3}{x + 4}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2x + 5}{x + 4} = 2 - \frac{3}{x + 4}
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the Result

The final result \(2 - \frac{3}{x + 4}\) (or equivalently \(-\frac{3}{x + 4} + 2\)) shows the simplified form of the original expression \(\frac{2x + 5}{x + 4}\).

### Conclusion:

Even without knowing the simplified form in advance, you can arrive at the correct result by using polynomial long division. This method breaks down the expression into a quotient and a remainder, giving you the simplified form.
